A Very Good Project created by Very Good CLI.

## Overview

**Nodelabs Case Study** is a cross-platform Flutter application built as a case study for **NodeLabs**. It is scaffolded with the [Very Good CLI](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_cli) and demonstrates scalable, maintainable architecture using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern and modular repository-driven structure. The project is designed to run on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows, but for this case study, **only the development flavor is implemented**.

---

## Features

- **Development flavor only:** The project structure supports multiple flavors, but only the development flavor is implemented for this case study.
- **Internationalization:** Uses the `slang` package for easy and robust localization.
- **Authentication:** User sign-in and registration flows.
- **Profile Management:** User profile and photo update.
- **Feed:** Movie feed and favorite movies.
- **Theming:** Custom UI theme via the `nodelabs_ui` package.
- **Caching:** Local data caching using Hive.
- **Analytics:** Event tracking via an analytics repository.
- **Modular Repositories:** Separate packages for API, authentication, user, movie, cache, analytics, and external media.

**Packages:**

- `analytics_repository`, `auth_repository`, `cache_repository`, `external_media_repository`, `movie_repository`, `user_repository`, `api_client`, `hive_client`, `nodelabs_ui` ‚Äî each with its own README and tests.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (see `pubspec.yaml` for version)
- Dart 3.5.0 or higher

### Running the App

Only the **development flavor** is implemented:

```sh
flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart
```

_Nodelabs Case Study works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

---

## Architecture

- **State Management:** Uses [BLoC](https://bloclibrary.dev/) for business logic and state, with `flutter_bloc` for UI integration.
- **Routing:** [GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) for declarative, type-safe navigation.
- **Dependency Injection:** Uses `RepositoryProvider` and `MultiRepositoryProvider` for injecting repositories.
- **Modularity:** Core features are separated into packages and feature folders for scalability.
- **Persistence:** Local cache via Hive, abstracted by the `cache_repository` and `hive_client` packages.
- **API Communication:** All network calls are abstracted through the `api_client` package.

---

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests:

```sh
flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report:

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
open coverage/index.html
```

---

## Internationalization üåê

- Uses the [`slang`](https://pub.dev/packages/slang) package for internationalization and localization.
- All localization files are located in `lib/i18n/` and are managed/generated by slang.
- To add a new string or locale, update the relevant files in `lib/i18n/` and regenerate the code using slang's build runner integration.
- For more information, see the [slang documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/slang).

---

## Assets

- All assets (icons, images) are located in the `assets/` directory and referenced in `pubspec.yaml`.
- Asset classes are generated in `lib/gen/assets.gen.dart`.

---

## Packages

Each package (e.g., `auth_repository`, `movie_repository`, etc.) contains:

- Its own README and documentation.
- Unit tests under `test/`.
- Strict linting and CI via [Very Good Analysis](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis).

---

## Contributing

- PR and issue templates are provided in each package.
- Code style and coverage are enforced via CI.
